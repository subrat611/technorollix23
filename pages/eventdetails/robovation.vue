        <p>
          Robo soccer is one of famous challenges of robovation in this event
          teams comes with single robot and chase ball around the big size of
          arena with the aim to kick more goals than the opponent these games
          give opportunity to youngsters to solve robotic challenges, built
          creative bots while learning engineering technology. the most
          rewarding part of designing bots is that student have fun, work
          together as a team and robot specially design for robo soccer match.
          the event is aimed at testing the flipping, kicking manueuvering
          skills and the control of the robot. The event mainly consists of
